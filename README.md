#code-open-source

This is a test to acclimate me to git-hub environements and extended utilities.

Open source developers have standardized a naming convention on files in repositories that store important information, such as project documentation or licensing requirements.

The most important file for many repositories its README, or “read me” file. It’s the standard file for basic repository documentation. Developers know to read it to learn how to use or contribute to the project.

Developers often put the project’s name in the first line of the README, followed by a blank line, then the project’s description.
